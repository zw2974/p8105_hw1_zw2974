# Problem 1

### Description of important variables and values in the dataset:

`origin`: Weather station. Named `origin` to facilitate merging with
`nycflights13::flights` data. The distinct weather stations included are
EWR.

`year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`: Time of recording. Data spans from 1 to
15 in January 2013.

`temp`, `dewp`: Temperature and dewpoint in F. The average temperature
for the month is approximately 39.58°F.

`humid`: Relative humidity. The avgerage humidity for this period is
around 65.48%.

`wind_dir`, `wind_speed`, `wind_gust`: Wind direction (in degrees),
speed and gust speed (in mph). AVG wind direction : 208.19

`precip`: Precipitation, in inches. AVG precipitation: 0.0020391

`pressure`: Sea level pressure in millibars. AVG pressure: 1022.5234375

`visib`: Visibility in miles. AVG visibility: 8.5153352

`time_hour`: Date and hour of the recording as a POSIXct date. AVG time
hour: 2013-01-08 12:28:09

### Size of dataset:

Consists of 358 rows and 15 columns

### Mean temperature:

The average temperature for the month is approximately 39.58°F.

### Patterns description:

The scatterplot shows a general increase in temperature from morning to
mid-afternoon, followed by a decrease during the evening. There seems to
be a higher concentration of points (indicating higher humidity) during
the early morning, which might be associated with dew or morning mist.
The evening temperatures, while cooler, don’t seem to show a strong
association with humidity. There are a few outliers on days where the
temperature is unexpectedly high or low, which might be worth further
investigation. The temperature has fluctuations while the general trend
is going up until around Jan.15. The humidity is generally higher after
Jan.7.

# Problem 2

### Data frame creation:

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##       nor log   char  factor
    ##     <dbl> <lgl> <chr> <fct> 
    ##  1 -0.626 FALSE a     level1
    ##  2  0.184 TRUE  b     level3
    ##  3 -0.836 FALSE c     level1
    ##  4  1.60  TRUE  d     level1
    ##  5  0.330 TRUE  e     level1
    ##  6 -0.820 FALSE f     level1
    ##  7  0.487 TRUE  g     level2
    ##  8  0.738 TRUE  h     level1
    ##  9  0.576 TRUE  i     level1
    ## 10 -0.305 FALSE j     level2

### When try to directly calculate the mean:

``` r
mean(df)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(df): 参数不是数值也不是逻辑值：回覆NA

    ## [1] NA

The warning shows some variables in the data frame can’t be directly
calculated

### Calculable variables:

``` r
mean_normal <- mean(df %>% pull(nor))
mean_logical <- mean(df %>% pull(log), na.rm = TRUE)
```

The mean value of the sample from normal distribution is 0.1322028

The mean value of the logical vector is 0.6

### For the following tow variables, the mean fuction would return “NA”

``` r
mean_character <- mean(df %>% pull(char)) 
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(df %>% pull(char)): 参数不是数值也不是逻辑值：回覆NA

``` r
mean_factor <- mean(df %>% pull(factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(df %>% pull(factor)): 参数不是数值也不是逻辑值：回覆NA

### To convert variables to numeric

Use `as.numeric`

    numeric_logical <- as.numeric(df$log)
    numeric_character <- as.numeric(df$char)
    numeric_factor <- as.numeric(df$factor)

For the logical variables, it would converted to 0 and 1 corresponding
to `T` and `F`

For the character variables, `NA` would be incurred as a replacement of
all the characters

For the factor variables, the levels of factors would convert to numeric
value 1, 2 and 3

In that case, character wouldn’t convert to the numeric variable which
explain the warning produced when using `mean` function.
